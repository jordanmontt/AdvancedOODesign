${slide:title=Goal}$

- What is inheritance?
- When to use it?

Pharo treats inheritance the same way as Java

${slide:title=The Basics}$

${columns}$

${column:width=60}$

- Often we want small adaptations
- we want to extend existing behavior and state
- solution: ""class inheritance""
- a class extends the definition of its superclass

a subclass
- can add state and behavior:
-- ==color==, ==borderColor==, ...
- can use superclass behavior and state
- can specialize and redefine superclass behavior

${slide:title=Root of Inheritance Hierarchy}$

${columns}$

${column:width=70}$

- ==Object== is the root of most classes
- ==ProtoObject== (==Object=='s superclass) is for special purposes...
-- ...but we will ignore it as it is not important

inheritance is
- static for state (i.e., during class creation)
- dynamic for behavior (i.e., during execution)

${slide:title=Inheritance of Instance Variables}$

${columns}$

${column:width=65}$

- happens during class definition
- computed from
-- the class own instance variables
-- the ones of its superclasses

${slide:title=Inheritance of Behavior}$

${columns}$

${column:width=50}$

- happens at runtime
- the method is searched
-- starting from the receiver's class
-- then going to the superclass

${slide:title=What You Should Know}$

- Inheritance allows a class to refine state and behavior
- A class has 1 and only 1 superclass
- A class eventually inherits from ==Object==
- Inheritance of state is static
- Inheritance of behavior is dynamic
