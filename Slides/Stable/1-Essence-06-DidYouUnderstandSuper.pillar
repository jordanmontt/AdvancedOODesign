${slide:title=A Little Puzzle}$

[[[
Die class >> new

  | inst |
  inst := super new.
  inst initialize.
  ^ inst
]]]

We execute the following expression: ==Die new==

${slide:title=Questions}$

[[[
Die class >> new

  | inst |
  inst := super new.
  inst initialize.
  ^ inst
]]]

- What is ==inst==?
- What is ==super==?
- What is ==super new==?

${slide:title=Hint: super is Not...}$

[[[
Die class >> new

  | inst |
  inst := super new.
  inst initialize.
  ^ inst
]]]

- No ==super== is not the superclass
- No ==inst== is not an instance of the superclass

${slide:title=Hint 2: super is the Message Receiver}$

[[[
Die class >> new

  | inst |
  inst := super new.
  inst initialize.
  ^ inst
]]]

- The message is ==Die new==
- So the receiver is the class ==Die==

${slide:title=Solution}$

[[[language=smalltalk
Die class >> new

  | inst |
  inst := super new.
  inst initialize.
  ^ inst
]]]

- ==super== is the receiver: the class ==Die==
- Look for ==new== in the superclass of the class ==Die class== (Pay attention not ==Die==)
- Once found we apply to the receiver: ==Die==
- We get an instance of the class ==Die== and send it initialize and return it

${slide:title=Summary}$

- Sending a message is looking up for the method and applying it on the receiver
- Now you should really understand ==super== :)
- ==super== is the receiver of the message and the method lookup starts in the superclass of the class  containing the expression

${slide:title=Challenge}$

Imagine we have:

[[[
A >> foo
   ^ super class == self class
]]]

What is the result of ==A new foo== and why?
