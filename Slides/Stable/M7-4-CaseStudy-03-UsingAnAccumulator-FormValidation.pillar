${slide:title=Objectives}$

- Think about objects
- Think about structure traversal
- Look at objects as accumulators



${slide:title=The case: Validation}$

- We want to validate UI forms
- Nested components may want to validate ""or not"" their contents
-- at input field or just at the pane level


+.>file://figures/ValidationExample.png|width=60+


${slide:title=Questions}$

- How can we navigate a tree of instances (widgets)?
- Where children can decide to be skipped?
- What do we report?


${slide:title=Validation}$

What should return the validation? 
- Yes/no?
- Specific objects with semantics 
-- e.g. filepath is isValid?

${slide:title=A first design}$

- Any presenter can validate its contents
- Per default does nothing

[[[
SpPresenter >> isValid
	^ true
]]]	

[[[	
SpPresenter >> report
	^ OkReport new
]]]

${slide:title=A given item can refine it}$


[[[
MyFilePathPresenter >> isValid
	^ self inputField isEndingBy: 'git'
]]]

[[[
MyFilePathPresenter >> report
	^ WrongFileEndingReport new expecting: 'git' ; for: self path
]]]

${slide:title=A first design: Container}$

A container defines the semantics of collection for its children

[[[
SpOptionPresenter >> isValid
	^ self children allSatisfy: [:each | each isValid ]
]]]

[[[	
SpOptionPresenter >> report
	| report |
	report := SpValidationReport new. 
	self children do: [ :childPresenter | 
		childPresenter isValid ifFalse: [ report add: childPresenter report ]].
	^ report
]]]


${slide:title=Flow's first design}$

+.>file://figures/DistributionOfReponsibility2.pdf|width=60+


${slide:title=Analysis}$

- To have a report we need to know if the validation failed or not
- Should ==isValid== return a report?
- If ==isValid== returns a report then we have to return an ok report for anybody

${slide:title=Flow's first design}$

${slide:title=Second design: provide an accumulator}$

Pass around a basket and let any sub instance decides if it wants to participate

+.>file://figures/DistributionOfReponsibility3.pdf|width=60+

${slide:title=Second design: default}$

By default do not add to the report

[[[
SpPresenter >> validateInto: aReport
	^ self
]]]


${slide:title=Second design: Containers and leaves}$

Each validating subcomponent
- gets the responsibility to fill up the report
- can bring its information to the report

[[[
MyFilePathPresenter >> validateInto: aReport
	^ aReport add: (WrongFileEndingReport new expecting: 'git'; for: self path)
]]]

[[[
SpOptionPresenter >> validateInto: aReport 

	self children do: [ :presenter | presenter validateInto: aReport ].
	^ aReport
]]]


${slide:title=Conclusion}$

- Question interrogative forms
- Let the object decides if it wants to join a process but passing a container
- You may also have some double dispatch between the report and the container
- Explore design
